# CollectivesLinks
A Pico CMS plugin for fixing Nextcloud Collectives links

# Why?
Nextcloud Collectives creates this markdown:

````
[Test](Known%20Issues%20%26%20ToDo.md?fileId=155813)
````
(which obviously won't work in Pico CMS)

This is what it should look like:

````
[Test](Known%20Issues%20%26%20ToDo)
````

This plugin converts (shortens) the URL.

# Installation
Just put the CollectivesLinks-folder in Pico's plugins/-folder. That's it.
