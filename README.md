# CollectivesLinks
A Pico CMS plugin for fixing Nextcloud Collectives links

# Why?

Nextcloud Collectives create this markdown:

````
[Test](Known%20Issues%20%26%20ToDo.md?fileId=155813)
````

This is what it should look like:

````
[Test](Known%20Issues%20%26%20ToDo)
````

This plugin converts (shortens) the URL.
